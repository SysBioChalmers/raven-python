"""Flux differences between two conditions — port of RAVEN's ``compareFluxes``.

Compares two flux distributions for the same model and reports every reaction
whose flux moved by more than ``cutoff``, largest change first, labelling the
ones that were turned on, turned off or reversed direction. Optionally
restricted to the reactions touching a given list of metabolite *names*.

The result is a tidy DataFrame plus id lists, rather than RAVEN's printed table
— the console rendering is presentation, and a DataFrame is what downstream
analysis actually wants.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model:
        The model both flux vectors are for.
    reference:
        Flux for the reference condition (e.g. wild type), indexed by reaction id.
        Every reaction in the model must be present.
    comparison:
        Flux for the condition being compared against it (e.g. a mutant).
    cutoff:
        A reaction is *active* when ``|flux| > cutoff``, and *changed* when
        ``|flux2 - flux1| > cutoff``. Both comparisons are strict.
    metabolite_list:
        Metabolite *names*, compared case-insensitively against
        ``Metabolite.name``. If given, only reactions touching at least one of
        them are compared; every other reaction is left out of the result
        entirely rather than reported as unchanged. A name matching no
        metabolite is reported in
