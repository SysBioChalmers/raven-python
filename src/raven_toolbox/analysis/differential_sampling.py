"""Flux-vs-expression change significance — port of RAVEN's ``getFluxZ`` and
``analyzeSampling``.

Both operate on the output of a random-sampling run comparing two conditions
(e.g. :func:`~raven_toolbox.analysis.random_sampling`): :func:`get_flux_z`
turns two sets of sampled flux vectors into a per-reaction Z-score for
whether flux increased or decreased between them, and :func:`analyze_sampling`
combines that Z-score with a per-reaction gene-expression t-score to say
whether a reaction's flux and expression changed together, only one of them
changed, or they moved in opposite directions.

``analyzeSampling.m`` calls ``getFluxZ.m`` directly and cannot be usefully
ported without it (SysBioChalmers/raven-gecko-parity#41), so both are ported
together here.

Sample orientation is *samples × reactions* (rows are samples, columns are
reaction ids) — the ``cobra.sampling`` convention
:func:`~raven_toolbox.analysis.random_sampling` already returns, and the
transpose of RAVEN's own reactions × samples arrays. This is a deliberate
adaptation, not a literal port of the axis RAVEN happens to reduce over: it
lets a sampling result be passed straight through with no manual transpose.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solutions_a:
        Sampled flux vectors for the reference condition, *samples × reactions*
        (e.g. ``random_sampling(...).samples``).
    solutions_b:
        Sampled flux vectors for the test condition, same reaction columns.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Z-score per reaction (indexed by ``solutions_a``'s columns): positive
        when flux increased from A to B, negative when it decreased, 0 when
        the means are equal, clamped to ``[-100, 100]``. A reaction with zero
        variance in both conditions gets exactly ``±100`` rather than a
        division by zero.

    Notes
    -----
    Fixes a real sign bug in the zero-variance branch of ``getFluxZ.m`` as it
    stands on RAVEN's ``develop3`` (a flux *decrease* with no variance in
    either condition scored ``+100``, backwards relative to the general
    formula): SysBioChalmers/RAVEN#742 makes the same correction upstream.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t_expression:
        t-score for the change in gene expression, one per reaction, in the
        same order as ``solutions_a``'s columns. Positive means expression
        increased, negative means it decreased. A p-value can be converted

        (the p-value alone does not carry direction).

        Degrees of freedom for the expression t-test.
    solutions_a, solutions_b:

        reactions* — see :func:`get_flux_z`.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Indexed by reaction id, with columns:

        - ``concordant`` — probability flux and expression both changed
          significantly, in the same direction (RAVEN's ``pR``).
        - ``expression_only`` — probability expression changed significantly
          but flux did not, or they changed in opposite directions (``pH``).
        - ``flux_only_or_discordant`` — probability flux changed
          significantly but expression did not, or they changed in opposite
          directions (``pM``).

    Notes
    -----
    Two simplifications relative to ``analyzeSampling.m``: it computes an
    "opposite flux direction" branch (``pM=erf(|Z|)``, ``pH=(1-pM)*...``,
    ``pR=0``) whose results are unconditionally overwritten by the very next
    branch before ``scores`` is ever read — dead code, verified by tracing
    every assignment, not replicated here. And it bundles its own ``tcdf``
    (a pure-MATLAB fallback for when the Statistics Toolbox isn't installed);
    this uses ``scipy.stats.t.cdf`` directly, which is exact and always
    available.
