"""N-model structural and functional comparison.

Compare two or more models — typically context-specific models extracted from the same
template — on their reactions, metabolites, genes, EC-codes, metabolite names, reaction
equations (with and without compartments), subsystems, and (optionally) which metabolic
tasks they perform. Returns tidy :class:`pandas.DataFrame`\\ s suitable for downstream
plotting (heatmaps, tSNE/MDS, …) in seaborn / scikit-learn; plotting is intentionally not
in this function so it stays usable inside pipelines.

All matrices use the union of ids/values across the input models as the row index, so
missing entries are unambiguously ``0`` / ``False`` rather than ``NaN``.

The ``ec_codes``/``metabolite_names``/``equations``/``equations_no_compartments`` matrices
are the only ones that compare models by something other than identifier — the useful case
when two models of the same organism do not share an id convention. RAVEN split this out
into a separate function, ``compareRxnsGenesMetsComps``; here it is one function, matching
RAVEN's own later merge of the two into ``compareMultipleModels``.

    """Tabular result of :func:`compare_models`.

    All matrices are indexed by id/value (reactions/metabolites/genes/ec_codes/
    metabolite_names/equations/equations_no_compartments/subsystems) with one column per
    model. ``presence`` matrices are 0/1; ``subsystems`` is the per-model reaction count
    per subsystem. ``similarity`` is the model × model Jaccard on the reaction set
    (1 = identical, 0 = disjoint). ``tasks`` is the per-model task pass/fail matrix
    (``None`` unless task checking was requested); ``failed_tasks`` maps each model id to
    the failure messages for the tasks it did not pass.

    ``equations``/``equations_no_compartments`` key each reaction by a canonical string
    built from its metabolites and stoichiometry: sides are sorted, and for a reversible
    reaction the side containing the lexicographically-first metabolite is written as the
    reactant side, so two reactions that are the same up to metabolite order or arbitrary
    reversible-direction compare equal. ``equations`` keeps compartments in each
    metabolite id; ``equations_no_compartments`` strips them.
