"""Gap analysis summary — port of RAVEN's ``gapReport``.

Runs a battery of connectivity checks over a model: which reactions cannot
carry flux (at all, and even if net production of every metabolite were
allowed), how the model's metabolites split into isolated sub-networks, which
metabolites cannot be net-produced and the minimal set of metabolites that
would need an external source to fix that, which metabolites can be produced
or consumed for free once every existing boundary reaction is closed, and
(optionally) how much of the remaining damage a set of template models could
repair.

Two of ``gapReport.m``'s own helpers — ``checkProduction`` and
``getAllSubGraphs`` — have no separate Python port: their only real caller in
RAVEN is ``gapReport`` itself (their ledger rows note this), so their logic
is folded in here as private helpers rather than exposed as reusable
functions with no second user. A third, ``canExchange``, is reimplemented the
same way for the same reason, on top of the same probe-reaction technique
:func:`~raven_toolbox.gapfilling.find_leak_metabolite` already uses.

``gapReport.m`` only runs its mass-balancing section
(``canProduceWithoutInput``/``canConsumeWithoutOutput``) when the model
carries RAVEN's legacy ``unconstrained`` metabolite marker — a v2-era way of
representing boundary metabolites that a ``cobra.Model`` has no equivalent
for (``simplify_model``'s own docstring notes the same gap for
``deleteUnconstrained``). This port always computes that section instead, by
temporarily closing every one of the model's own boundary reactions first —
strictly more informative, and well-defined for any model regardless of how
it was built.
