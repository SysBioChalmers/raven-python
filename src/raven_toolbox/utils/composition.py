"""Infer missing metabolite formulas from elemental mass balance.

Port of RAVEN's ``guessComposition``. Where a reaction has exactly one
participant with an unknown formula and every other participant's formula is
known, the unknown one's elemental composition can be recovered from the
reaction's own mass balance. This is repeated to a fixed point, since
resolving one metabolite can unlock others.

    """Infer missing metabolite formulas from elemental mass balance.

    Modifies ``model`` in place: resolved metabolites get their ``formula``
    (and ``elements``) set. Metabolites sharing a name (e.g. the same
    compound in different compartments) are resolved and assigned together,
    since composition does not depend on compartment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model:
        Model to fill in formulas for.
    print_results:
        Print each resolved metabolite's name and guessed formula.

    Returns
    -------
    GuessCompositionResult

    Notes
    -----
    Requires that the existing formulas and reactions are correct, and warns
    if a metabolite would need inconsistent compositions from different
    reactions -- so it can also be used to check a model for such errors.
    Successful completion does not guarantee correctness if the pre-existing
    formulas were themselves wrong.

    Each pass resolves formulas using a snapshot of what was already known
    at the start of that pass: a metabolite resolved earlier in the same
    pass only helps resolve others starting from the next pass, matching
    the original algorithm's own once-per-pass formula parsing.

    A metabolite instance that does not participate in any reaction
    contributes nothing either way -- it neither resolves the name nor
    blocks a resolution reached through a different compartment instance.
